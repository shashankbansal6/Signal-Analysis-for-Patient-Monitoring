Task 1.1 - Part a
2. The difference between the pmf plotted in part 1 and the estimated pdf is
that pmf gives discrete probabilities at different values whereas pdf gives the
probability that the given function falls in the particular interval.

3. As the sample size increases from 70 to 30000, the cdf graph becomes more smooth
and regular.

Task 1.1 - Part b
1. Tabulate(X) gives a pdf while the other gives a pmf because:
each value in the X is unique so tabulate(X) gives the same value throughout the interval
whereas using floor gives an integer count between the discreet intervals and thus each interval.
has a different probability which is the pmf of the function.

2. The difference for the derived min and max for each distribution is shown below
Min of tabulate(X) = 0.003333
Max of tabulate(X) = 0.003333
Min of tabulate(floor(X)) = 0.000000
Max of tabulate(floor(X)) = 5.490000
Observed Property of PDF = PDFs involve continuous RVs, and the probability of any single possible value is 0

Task 1.1 - Part c
Empirical a = 10.146654
Empirical b = 37.095505

Task 1.2 - Part a
Mean RESP = 21.741818

Standard Deviation RESP = 7.104292

Task 1.2 - Part c
The distribution generated in this task is positive skewed that is
the right tail is slightly longer and the mass distribution is concentrated on the
left of the figure.


Task 1.2 - Part d
Theoretical a = 7.169335
Theoretical b = 36.344267

The values of a and b in task 1.2 are less than the values in task 1.1 that is the empirical values are more than the theoretical values.

Task 2.2 - Parts a and b
Using Empirical Thresholds:
Probability of False Alarm    = 0.023482
Probability of Miss Detection = 0.000000
Probability of Error          = 0.023333

Task 2.2 - Part c
Using Theoretical Thresholds:
Probability of False Alarm    = 0.016102
Probability of Miss Detection = 0.052632
Probability Error             = 0.016333

The probability of False Alarm and Probability of Error went down using theoretical thresholds.
The probability of miss detection is more in the case of theoretical threshold whereas its 0 for empirical

Following are the observations from the values generated by the empirical approach vs the theoretical approach:

	- empirical finds the results by observing and finding straight from the data whereas the theoretical values were calculated by
	  normalising the data and then finding from its cdf
	
	- empirical thresholds are higher than theoretical thresholds for false alarm and error whereas the probability of miss detections is
	  more in case of theoretical threshold
	
	- Also, as the number of observations increases and approaches infinity, the empirical value comes closer to the theoretical 
	  value and is less skewed. 

Task 3
Mean Probability of False Alarm = 0.028094
Mean Probability of Miss Detection = 0.000000
Mean Probability of Error = 0.028000
The average of false alarm probability and error probability all went up just by a little bit from the values in Task 2.2
The probability of miss dections is the same which is 0.
